This Repo contains the code for my RA work for Prof.Dacheng Xiu and Zhouyu Shen, for the paper 'Can Machine Learn Weak Signals?'
## There are six dataset that our model are tested on, and models are namely Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, GBRT, Neural Networks with L1 Regularization and L2 Regularization.
## Also, I include the code for conducting variable importance visualization code in this paper.
